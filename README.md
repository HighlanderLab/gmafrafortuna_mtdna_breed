# gmafrafortuna_mtdna_breed

A simulation study using AlphaSimR to simulate both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes
in the context of a dairy cattle breeding programme. The study looks at how accountning
for nuclear and mitochondrial genome variation in estmation of breeding values and selection
impacts the accuracy of estimation and the magnitude of response to selection.

This study was initiated as an intership of Gabriela Mafra Fortuna during her MSc in Animal
Breeding and Genetics, which then became her MSc thesis, and finally the following paper.

To run the simulation, run the `replicates_run.R` script. The script states the required R packages.
